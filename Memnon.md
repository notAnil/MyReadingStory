He led a defence in Halicarnassus against [[Siege of Halicarnassus]].  He battled Alexander the Great and tried to use scorched earth tactics on Aegean territories and provoke the Greeks city states to rebel and arm against [[Alexander the Great]] but died to an illness before he could execute this plan. Alexander was elated when he learned that Memnon of Rhodes died.

Memnon of Rhodes (Greek: Μέμνων ὁ Ῥόδιος; c. 380 – 333 BC) was a prominent Rhodian Greek commander in the service of the Achaemenid Empire. Related to the Persian aristocracy by the marriage of his sister to the satrap Artabazus II, together with his brother Mentor he served the Persian king for most of his life, and played an important role during the invasion of Alexander the Great and the decades before that.[1]

Carl Otis Schuster notes that though often inaccurately described as "simply a mercenary", Memnon was arguably the toughest defender of the Persian Empire Alexander had to face, and was nearly successful in putting a halt to him.
