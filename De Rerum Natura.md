A poem of 6 books by the author Lucretius. We don't know if he committed suicide or the suicide is a myth started by his philosophical enemies.

The books is an attempt to introduce [[Epicureanism]] to Rome. 
In the book he predicts that Earth is not the only habitable planet and it will also meet it's end. 

He writes about his imitation and understanding of Epicurean; physics, ethics, religion.
His ideas on development of body is a precursor to Darwin's evolution.

He rejected divine intervention explanations and tried to give answers based on his limited understanding of materialism of his time, with this process he had pretty advanced interpretation of the world for his time. 

He was against organized religion. We shall not try to appease Gods but try to be happy and well in here where we exist.
