A giant in sciences. He contributed to [[Materialism]] and objective ideas. He stated that earth revolves around itself and sun, therefore he got persecuted by the church. Even though he signed papers that said that he resigned from that statement he said that: "And yet it moves" or "Although it does move" (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove). Although it is debated if he was the one who invented telescope, he was the first one to use it to look at the stars. 

What he did:
+ Fist to look at the stars with a telescope
+ Found the Pendulum principle, therefore initiated a big change in clocks.
+ Found thermometer.
+ Found that the fall time is unaffected by weight and and the fall speed and the increasement of that speed is same for all things regardless of weight.
+ Proved that an artillery shell made a parabolic flight, thus started the artillery science.
+ Proved that if an object doesn't have any other force effecting it it will keep doing what it does.(Just like first principle of [[Newton]]).
+ Proved that if more than one force are effecting the object, object will be effected as if all of them did their parts separately.
+ His findings on forces would lead to a new science called dynamic to be found.
+ With him objective understanding in science progressed.
These are just some of them. He then criticized Church for meddling in science.
