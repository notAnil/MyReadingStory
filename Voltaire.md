Voltaire, an 18th-century French philosopher and writer, was a central figure of the Enlightenment, known for his advocacy of civil liberties, freedom of speech, and separation of church and state. His sharp wit and critical style, exemplified in works like "Candide" and "Letters on England," challenged established institutions and dogmas, particularly targeting religious intolerance and authoritarianism. Voltaire argued for reason and empirical evidence as foundations of knowledge, promoting skepticism toward superstition and fanaticism.

He was also a proponent of enlightened despotism, believing that a wise ruler could bring about reform and progress. Voltaire's correspondence with figures like Frederick the Great of Prussia showcased his hopes for a more rational and just society. His ideas on tolerance and human rights significantly influenced revolutionary thought, making him a vital precursor to modern secular and liberal principles.
