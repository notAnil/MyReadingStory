David Hume, an 18th-century Scottish philosopher, emphasized empiricism and skepticism. He argued that knowledge arises from sensory experiences and questioned causation, suggesting we infer it from habit rather than direct observation. Hume challenged metaphysics by asserting that many traditional concepts, like the self and God, lack empirical grounding, viewing them as constructs of the mind.

He believed our understanding of causation and the world is shaped by repeated experiences, leading us to expect outcomes based on habit rather than rational deduction. Similarly, he argued that beliefs and morality are rooted in feelings rather than reason, highlighting the limits of human understanding and the role of subjective experience in shaping our worldview.
