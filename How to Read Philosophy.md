1. Make time for it, where you have your notebook or your pen and so on.
2. Prepare to read twice. Understand read then engage read.
3. Take clear notes. While taking notes there are three things to look for: 1. a clear statement of a thesis. 2. points of your confusion 3. make connection to other thinkers.
4. What is this book about, why are you reading it. What is the philosopher is arguing about. How does the philosophers stand in history. What is the evidence author puts out for his thesis. Don't just try to falsify arguments, try to find weaknesses and analyze it.
