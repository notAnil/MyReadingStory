After [[Aristotle]]'s student [[Alexander the Great]] created the Hellenic Empire prominent Greek city states became obsolete and lost their cultural hegemony. 
After Alexander's death his empire got divided into many parts fighting with each other. Though cultural unison he created lasted the political unity was destroyed. In this time 4 new philosophical schools were formed: [[Cynics]], [[Skepticism]], [[Epicureanism]] and [[Stoicism]].

With Stoicism Western Philosophy which used to be Greek became universal. It was very common in Roman Empire. Was founded by Zeno of Citium.

Nothing further from reason. The nature is reality. Nature can be understood with reason. We are a part of the nature. God is what fills us and nature (which contains us); spirit of reason. God is not apart from nature, it contains the nature. Stated in a certain way, God is the intelligence of the world, and world aware of itself.

There is nothing after death. We can't change nature, and shouldn't try to change it anyway. The reasoning behind this is that everything in nature has reasons. When life became too hard stoics preferred to kill themselves. Many stoic philosophers died by suicide. Their thoughts on reason in nature and that we can't change nature led them to believe that as long as we choose to live we need to endure pain.

The foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself, in wisdom and self-control. One must therefore strive to be free of the passions. For the Stoics, reason meant using logic and understanding the processes of natureâ€”the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. The Greek word pathos was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers. The Stoics used the word to discuss many common emotions such as anger, fear and excessive joy. A passion is a disturbing and misleading force in the mind which occurs because of a failure to reason correctly.

Stoic ethics has effected Christian ethics; therefore [[Christian Philosophy]].
