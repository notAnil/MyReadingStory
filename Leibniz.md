Found calculus again and published it before Newton, mathematicians of today use Leibniz's calculus notation.

He found the notion of kinetic energy.
He found the mathematical logic, although he didn't publish it. If he had published his math logic findings the area would be a half century earlier.

He thought that we either check a statement if it is true or look at it if it has contradictions within itself.
He separated these two statements as synthetic and analytical propositions. These terms are still used today. 
This distinction was the center of empiric  philosophy and [[Kant]]'s philosophy.

Sufficient reason:
Everything have a reason to exist. He distinguishes between contingent beings, which depend on other things for their existence, and necessary beings, which must exist. For every contingent being, there must be a sufficient reason outside of itself. This principle suggests that the existence of anything requires a deeper explanation. To avoid infinite regress in explanations, there must be a foundational being. Leibniz argues that this ultimate cause is a necessary being, often identified with God. Thus, God serves as the ultimate reason for why anything exists at all. The principle has significant implications for metaphysics and theology. It emphasizes that nothing happens without sufficient reason. Overall, Leibniz's argument highlights the search for explanations in the nature of reality. // AI summary
