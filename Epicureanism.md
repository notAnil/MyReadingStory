After [[Aristotle]]'s student [[Alexander the Great]] created the Hellenic Empire prominent Greek city states became obsolete and lost their cultural hegemony. 
After Alexander's death his empire got divided into many parts fighting with each other. Though cultural unison he created lasted the political unity was destroyed. In this time 4 new philosophical schools were formed: [[Cynics]], [[Skepticism]], [[Epicureanism]] and [[Stoicism]].

Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BCE based upon the teachings of Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus was an atomist and materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His [[Materialism]] led him to religious skepticism and a general attack on divine intervention. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, and its main opponent later became Stoicism. It is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal. However, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from hedonism as colloquially understood.

Epicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer. All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red. The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move.

He questioned god's ethics.

Death is nothing for us. We only exist in a living state, when we die we don't exist so there is no need for us to fear death. Because we face certain destruction we shall enjoy life. (There are [[Absurdism]] and [[Existentialism]] similarities in setting your living without God and seeing death as the end of existence.).
 He was against organized religion. We shall not try to appease Gods but try to be happy and well in here where we exist.

Infinite body and infinite void. We are formed from special atoms and just like atoms fall apart from each other objects dissolve and die.

Has a big impact on modern understanding of science and [[Humanism]]. Really important on modern life perspective.
