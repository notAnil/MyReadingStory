First philosopher to think that religious writings are historical documents which show the thought restrictions of their time.

Shined telescope glasses, died because he inhaled those dusts and caught a lung disease (RIP).

Science especially optics had an influence on his thoughts. 
Agreed with [[Descartes]]. Obvious facts -> reasoning.

If man= mind(stupid)+matter(nothing matters anymore, which Arkham quote should I use?); then how can matter influence mind, since they are two very different things?

Fought with his thoughts on non-existence of free will.

No diff between mind and matter-> mind=matter(Does matter mind, is it not stupid?)

Nothing cannot be not God.
God exists with everything that exists.

Body is the souls outer reflection?

By making the nature god he became a great figure for the romantics.

Spinoza was an adamant determinist, and he denied the existence of free will.
(Universe is a deterministic machine. -[[Hasan the Half Rotten]])

His thoughts that human mind is influenced by other factors was an precursor to [[Freud]].

Nevertheless, his philosophy champions freedom, both ethically and politically. It provides an ethics without free will but one that leads to freedom, virtue, and happiness.

[[Wittgenstein]] got inspired by him.

He supported freedom of thought and said that freedom of thought protected public order. now this thought is central to liberal thought but it was Spinoza who put it forward first.
Later on we see somehow similar thing in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

His masterpiece "Ethics" is about a geometry book.  
To understand reality is to understand God; therefore we need to study science. 

Shah of [[Pantheism]]. 

Rejected Cartesian double. 
Influenced a lot of thinkers and even scientists.
