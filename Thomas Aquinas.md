Pope 13th Leo declared him a model for Catholic thinking, so he has a big part [[Christian Philosophy]] where he took ideas from everywhere and synthesized them with Christian Philosophy.
He even took ideas from Islamic and Judaist worlds. He introduced [[Aristotle]]'s ideas to Christian Philosophy that already soaked [[Plato]]'s ideas. 

He protected the distinction between philosophy and religion. He supported the Aristotle that all of our rational ideas come from our senses and a new born child is like a "tabula rasa", a clean board. Tabula rasa was then attributed to John Locke.

His empiric information theory seems very against religious beliefs but Thomas says it is impossible for them to have a conflict with revelations.

He is the one who distinguished essence and existence. He refuted [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s ontological argument for God saying that giving the proof of essence of god doesn't mean that it exists since you can give essence of a unicorn but it's existence is absent from reality. God is pure existence since unlike real world his essence can not come before his essence.

The question if essence or existence comes first would become a grand question in spheres of philosophy, where the conflict between [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] also fit in.
